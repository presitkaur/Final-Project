The missions are tons of funI''m in pretty strong disagreement with a lot of the critics about this game, mainly with concern to the story. I personally thought it was brilliant, moving the series in a new direction and setting up a fantastic jump-off point for Halo 6. I also want to stress what others have been saying: FAMILIARIZE YOURSELVES WITH THE LORE. That cannot be stressed enough. The missions are tons of fun though, harder than they used to be given the increased number of enemies in each area. But already I can think of a few absolutely great moments from the campaign that I think I''ll remember for a while to come. The only complaint I will make is a very noticeable lack of characterization for the new characters, especially disappointing for Blue Team, making their debut in the games universe.From the little I''ve seen of the multiplayer, it''s very fun. I played a Warzone match that surprised me with just how balanced it was. With REQ (Requisitions), boss and AI enemies, and a large, evolving map, it would be easy for it to devolve into a **** but it is incredibly well done. I''m also very glad they made SWAT a highlight; it has always been my favourite Halo game mode.Now, even though I give the game a solid 9 for great campaign and excellent online, I need to lambast 343i for their omission of split-screen. I have been quite upset that I can''t play this with my roommate, as we have played through every other game, and I have heard the sad stories of many others who feel like they''ve lost something that helped connect them to friends and family. The decision to omit split-screen for a 60 FPS framerate is, in my opinion, absurd. This 60 FPS movement has gained traction out of nowhere, for no purpose, and frankly I''m sick of it. I couldn''t give two **** if The Last of Us 2 is 60 FPS, and the same goes for any other that has been or will be announced. When you leave out such a core feature from your game to please your publisher with ammo for their marketing, you need to look at yourself as a developer and think again. If you stop advertising 60 FPS, there will be no riots. There will be no pushback. No one cares. It''s a gimmick, and an excusable one until it starts making your games less fun. I hold out a strong hope that both 343i and Microsoft will see the error they''ve made here, but until then, shame on them for ripping out a major organ of the Halo series'' body.Halo 5 is great.');

Based on the Middle Earth film adoptions by Peter Jackson, “Shadow of Mordor” acts as a bridge between “The Hobbit” and “The Lord of the Rings” trilogy. ItIn a way, “Shadow of Mordor” is a quality title nearly as good as “Batman: Arkham Asylum” and “Assassin’s Creed II”. While the game borrows aspects from both, it also stands apart with its own innovative feature, the Nemesis system. Based on the Middle Earth film adoptions by Peter Jackson, “Shadow of Mordor” acts as a bridge between “The Hobbit” and “The Lord of the Rings” trilogy. It also introduces a new protagonist, a ranger named Talion. During the prologue, Talion and his family are ritualistically killed by The Black Hand of Sauron. However, Talion is merged with the wraith of an Elf Lord named Celebrimbor and gains wraith-like abilities. Shortly after, they embark on a quest to avenge the deaths of their loved ones. If it sounds a little like a Middle Earth version of “The Crow”, it really isn’t. This is an open-world action game very similar to Ubi Soft’s “Assassin’s Creed” and “Far Cry 3” in terms of structure. It also features the intuitive combat system introduced in “Batman: Arkham Asylum”. What it brings to the table is the Nemesis system which affects the Orc armies in several different ways. For instance, if you kill a Captain, power shifts as the other Orcs rise in rank and fight for promotions. If a Captain survives your attacks, they’ll increase in power and change in appearance (to reflect their wounds). As you progress, you’ll eventually gain the ability to pit Orcs against each other. It’s a brilliant innovative feature that brings a sense of unpredictability to the battlefield.  The core gameplay of SOM is a hack n’ slash affair with plenty of side-missions and objects scattered throughout the map. The progression system is similar to the one featured in “Far Cry 3”. There is a “tree branch” chart that represents the different groups of abilities you can earn and upgrade. And just like in the 2013 reboot of “Tomb Raider”, you can discover hidden objects that reveal information about the past. Rated ‘M’ for bloody violence, this game is a major gorefest. You’ll decapitate countless of Orcs as you progress through the game. In fact, one of the most impressive features of SOM is the lack of lag during encounters with numerous enemies on-screen. The framerate never falters during these intense moments. Overall, “Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor” is a near masterpiece of the hack n’ slash genre. The Nemesis system, a solid story, smooth combat mechanics and impressive production values really make it shine. It’s an example of how to make a really good action game based on an existing property. I’d rank it with a 9 out of 10.');

Yes, you read correctly. What you''re paying the $60 price tag for is a multiplayer game. There is nothing new nor "innovative" about this game (as most sell-out critics would like for you to believe). You want to play a fast paced shooter? How about the latest Call of Duty or Battlefield installment or any shooter these days? You want to play a mech game? How about Hawken? BTW Hawken is free-to-play and the graphics is virtually identical to this one. So basically what this game does is combine the most prominent parts from other games and calls it innovation. And you''re paying $60 for it... for a multiplayer game.This is why I never read the critics reviews, I only scan through them and from the looks of it the majority of them gave this game a 90 or higher LOL. Something fishy is going on. Can you believe this bullshiiiet! What I do read are the mixed and negative reviews from the critics and the reviews from the users. I never based my decision on buying games from critics reviews because they are mostly sell-outs giving a higher score to the company that can pay them the most. Because of this unprofessionlism by the so called "critics", I have fully replaced them with the User Reviews as my new source for professional criticism. After all, it''s the majority consensus that matters. Therefore, if the critics gave a game a 9/10 or even a perfect 10 but the users gave it a **** score, I''m going to side with the user''s base decisions.');

It manages to reward both, without making either feel they have missed out on something. The story mode should always be considered a bonus in a fighting game as that is NOT when the genre is for, in the same way that many FPS games have short campaigns, this adds as a sweet addition to the epic multi player (or single player v AI) modes with a bucket load of options and customization''s (the test your luck has over 100 game modifiers for some truly amusing and outlandish matches). That said the story plays likes a beautiful CGI 4 hour movie, so stop whining about that!The sound is epic: bone crunches and blood splatter are sickeningly visceral as are the X ray attacks and fatalities. Overall a very fun over the top infinitely repayable fan favourite in the fighting series. Even if you are not a fan of the genre (which I am not) it is a quality purchase - 9/10');

The story is rather uninspired as compared to the last few games, with only a few key characteristics making it enjoyable. Without these though, the story does nothing to impress. The combat and predator sections have been greatly improved however, this time introducing complexity that actually makes the game better, not just more layered. Overall, a good end to the series, but not on par at all with its predecessors. Farewell Arkham series, you were truly good to me.');
