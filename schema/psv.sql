You think that this will be another fun and easy shooter, and then you get killed... This game kills you IN ONE HIT!! This is quite possibly one of the hardest games I''ve ever played, And I haven''t played Dark Souls yet. However, aside the extremely high difficulty, this indie game is an addictive and fun topdown action game set in 1989. Hotline Miami is developed by a few people at Dennaton Games and published by Devolver Digital and Abstraction Games. This game also has a very catchy, memorable and cool soundtrack. At first glance, the game looks like a topdown, pixelated  version of a game like Saints Row (excluding the insane Saints Row 4) or Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. But when you play it, you will find it to be like an extremely difficult but simple topdown indie action game that has a great soundtrack, colourful visuals and fast-paced gory shootouts. There are also a few bosses, which, unlike regular enemies, take more than 1 hit to kill. Overall, Hotline Miami is an addictive, fun and colourful indie game with great music and fast-paced gameplay, it is only slightly let down by its ultra high and frustrating difficulty. One thing is guaranteed is this game, though: YOU WILL DIE. A LOT. There''s even a trophy named ''Karma'' awarded to you if you die 1000 times. Even though Hotline Miami is a really hard game, I still highly recommend it. And, until late August, it''s in the Summer Sale on the PlayStation Store for £3.99/ $5.99. It includes Cross-Buy as well, allowing you to download the PS3 version of Hotline Miami for no extra cost. A must-buy indie game.');

This is 2013 I MUST HAVE TITLE. I love mario, zelda, jax, ratchet, but this game was really something thats is made only once in a decade.');

As fan of previous work by DrinkBox (mainly Guacamelee), this game doesn''t disappoint. Amazing art style, music, involving combat. It''s not immensely challenging, but it is quite involving. Also getting that 100% is a joy :) For the price, it''s definitely worth it!');

I don''t think I can remember a game that has made me laugh so much! Not to say there aren''t some tender moments, but I think it is safe to say that Persona 4 is an action comedy. Throw in a murder mystery, a killer-on-the-loose, great extras and tons of optional missions, and you''ve got the game of the year. Every day''s great at your Junes!');

Sure it´s a funny little platform´er, but that is really all it is!

My verdict is that Guacamelee! is a funny little platform game nothing more nothing less..');

I''ll say it upfront, i''m giving this game a 10/10. I enjoyed the game very much.The story about a young boy who was sent to live with his uncle in the countryside, Inaba Town. He will have to live there for a year. The first time he arrived, lots of rumor about the midnight channel and peopleJust finished Persona 4 The Golden last night. I must admit that this game is a MASTERPIECE. I''ll say it upfront, i''m giving this game a 10/10. I enjoyed the game very much.The story about a young boy who was sent to live with his uncle in the countryside, Inaba Town. He will have to live there for a year. The first time he arrived, lots of rumor about the midnight channel and people missing. What exactly happened in Inaba & what''s our hero role in all of this? Play and find it out.Plus point:- This game has like every aspect to make the game enjoyable. First of all, a strong main story. I mean yeah, you are a high schooler who is a student at days while playing the role of a guy who can summon persona and whack the ass of Shadows? That''s pretty much cool. And not just that, we got lines of strong supporting characters. You could unfold what happened in Inaba, searching for the truth or stop at the false truth, it''s all up to you. Because the fate of the story is in your hand.- Social links & normal life! Supporting characters are not just supporting characters, you can actually bond with them and get extra side story. Our hero is a high school student, so it''s just normal to have activities outside school. You can go on a date, hang out with your friends, find a girlfriend, eat at the restaurant, learn more about your friends, you can do part time jobs, read books, make lunch, etc. This makes the game just real and we can relate it to our life as well.- Music! Shoji Meguro is definitely a genius. He writes most of the songs for the Megami Tensei series and yes, this game has addictive music. The battle music, theme song, background music, it''s just awesome. It makes you enjoy the game more than ever.- Persona 4 The Golden is like a complete edition of Persona 4. At first i thought just some extra scene and a little upgrade. I was wrong. The new shuffle system, extra scene of going skiing, going to beach, festival & stuffs? It''s just awesome. New social link like Marie and her true story? That''s just awesome. This is my 2nd time playing it and i''m still amazed by the new contents. Costumes, Riding Bike, 3rd Evolution. Epilogue showing how''s your friend a year later, & etc. Thumbs up Atlus, just...awesome.Minus Point:- Seriously? None. But if i have to point it out. You can get the "True" True Ending only if you play it the 2nd time. Well, most people would love to play it again. But not for me, uh-uh. I don''t like playing the whole game for the 2nd time. But by playing it the 2nd time, that means you can get the other Social Link that you haven''t got the first time. Well it''s all about perspective though.After all i REALLY....REALLY recommend you to buy this game if you own a Vita. This game is a masterpiece and you GOT to have this game. 10/10, nuff said & just grab the f*cking game.');
