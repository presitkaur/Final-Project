The Last Guardian,PlayStation4,2,"Dear Team IcoYou had EIGHT YEARS to optimise a game that was originally designed for the PLAYSTATION THREE!Hell the visuals still look like a PS3 game, and yet the framerate keeps hitting sub 20fps on the PLAYSTATION FOUR!I wanted to really like this game but this is simply unacceptable. I can look past the dated visuals but not when the game is running this poorly."
Uncharted 4: A Thief's End,PlayStation4,5,"When I learnt that Amy Hennig was replaced by Neil Druckmann during the development of Uncharted 4, I feared the worst. A globe trotting adventure filled with wonder, mystery and excitement like Indiana Jones was going to turn into a chase movie called National Treasure. Yes, some of the action sequences were very well crafted and amazing to play through. Uncharted 4 was the mostWhen I learnt that Amy Hennig was replaced by Neil Druckmann during the development of Uncharted 4, I feared the worst. A globe trotting adventure filled with wonder, mystery and excitement like Indiana Jones was going to turn into a chase movie called National Treasure. Yes, some of the action sequences were very well crafted and amazing to play through. Uncharted 4 was the most technically polished installment and a sight to behold in the whole franchise. However, it was the pacing of the story in the third act that dragged it down like a 4x4 jeep struggling through thick mud.The problem was the developers were trying to duplicate their success in The Last of Us. They tried to make it more gritty and realistic, this sucked out the wonder and discovery that were the hallmarks of the series. Think of a Survivor Island type reality show where ordinary people were at each other's throats for a shot at fame and fortune. Nothing more, nothing less. No wonder, no mystery.The third act was filled with repetitive environmental puzzles and endless CoD inspired battles of A.I. grenade spamming and cheap enemy sniper kills. The end of the story was nearly in sight, but it felt like the developers were trying to prolong the playtime and it felt like a slog.If you are long time fan of the Uncharted series and you are a completionist, Uncharted 4 still entertains as it does have its moments. However, it is a beautiful view with an empty hole in the ground where the hear and soul of the series has been long dug out."

Los contras a mi pareces son pocos, quizás no me cierra mucho el mapa, tendría que haber mas armas y tendrían que ser un poco mas violentos los movimientos en la pelea y por ultimo, me gustaría que salte, no es algo que sea fundamental para la jugabilidad general del juego, pero le otorgaría mas realismo a la totalidad del juego... En fin, es un juego que da placer al jugarlo y voy a esperar con ansias futuras entregas... Soy feliz al existir en estos tiempos de avances tecnológicos, donde puedo disfrutar de este tipo de obras de arte videojugables!!! Gracias a Estudios Santa Monoica por semejante creación y Gracias a Sony por crear la Playstation 4 pro!!! Me hicieron muy feliz!!!"
Skylanders SuperChargers,PlayStation4,3,"Skylanders Superchargers is the fifth installment of the Skylanders franchise that I forced myself to finish because the sixth one is out.And I regret it.The gimmick is vehicles, and it's a pretty stupid gimmick. You need a land, sea, and air vehicle to experience everything the game has to offer, but the game only comes with a land vehicle. I didn't buy any additional toysSkylanders Superchargers is the fifth installment of the Skylanders franchise that I forced myself to finish because the sixth one is out.And I regret it.The gimmick is vehicles, and it's a pretty stupid gimmick. You need a land, sea, and air vehicle to experience everything the game has to offer, but the game only comes with a land vehicle. I didn't buy any additional toys (because I have far too many kicking around as is) so I didn't get to experience two thirds of the vehicle segments. that angered me at first, but the ones I could play were fairly generic and bland, so maybe it's not such a bad thing that I got to avoid most of them.Battle mode is absent yet again, as is it's former replacement, the Kaos Challenge thing from Trap Team. The little rhythm minigame is gone too, but I don't think it was ever the most popular addition. I barely even remember the plot, even though I finished the game just last week, so it couldn't have been great. Your collection of traps from Trap Team is usable, but they only serve as weapons for your vehicle. I stopped using them halfway through because they barely made a difference.The traditional Skylanders gameplay is pretty much unchanged, so there's that. There's also an online mode, but I couldn't get it to work. The game is still backwards compatible with old figures, so your existing collection should carry over just fine.Overall, very disappointing. I'd avoid it if at all possible."
Salt and Sanctuary,PlayStation4,10,"I absolutely loved this game. Metroidvanias are my favorite kind of games, and I also love the Souls series and Bloodborne, so this game seemed right up my alley.

It's just as satisfying as a Souls game, probably not as hard, but still a decent challenge, which is rare in Metroidvania games these days. But the real surprise is that it is also a great Metroidvania game. It follows all the rules: One big unified map, areas locked behind new abilities and locked doors, backtracking, shortcuts, all of that with the combat and leveling system find in the souls game translated beautifully to a 2D platform game.The combat has that Souls heft, and weapons really do work differently. Just like Souls, you can create your heavy armored mage, or light armored heavy hammer fighter, etc... New Game + is part of the deal as well. The main game is quite long too, especially generous considering this is a game made by a small indie studio and retails for 17.99. A bargain if you asked me, because it offers really great value for that price. I know I will be revisiting this game often and it's now part of a select group of games that are for me part of the pinnacle of the Metroidvania genre: Symphony of the Night, Super Metroid, Guacamelee!, Metroid Fusion, Order of Ecclesia, and Dawn/Aria of Sorrow."
Nioh,PlayStation4,4,"I have never played a Dark Souls game before so this seemed like a good chance to not only play a Dark Souls clone but a very well made Dark Souls clone.

Except this one is based a little more in reality because the setting is Shogun Japan rather than Emo Edgelord.I also learned that I don’t like this Genre because it’s just not for me. There is a steep learning curve that I just wasn’t willing to put the time in. For two major reasons, one I don’t like Stamina meters. It’s not really where I want to mash buttons but I prefer to block and be patient but the game punishes you for blocking or dashing or attacking by lowering your stamina for everything. To me, the game felt less like playing a game for fun and more meter management.From what it seems, its a very well received game but its just not for me. I’m glad that I’m trying all of these games and learning what I like and don’t like. This is an RPG but its a very specific RPG that just doesn’t fit the way that I play games."

Horizon Zero Dawn,PlayStation4,10,"I had a lot of fun playing this game, roaming around in its gorgeous environments and attacking the variety of different machines and their weak points with the weapons available is very satisfying. One of the best games I've played this generation, 10/10"

Destiny 2,PlayStation4,6,"Whatever your opinion is on Bungie's IP Destiny, the fact is that as a self described FPS looter shooter, Destiny 2 fails.

This has become more and more apparent to gamers in passing years with  competition coming into the genre's market; the Division, Warframe, etc. Of course the most important and clear flaw with this sequel is its regression from the first game, largely due to continued mismanagement and bad decision making on the part of Bungie. Supposedly there was only an 18 month period for the rollout of the now sequel. This would explain the complete lack of content and loss of essential features that were available in year 3 Destiny 1, coming into D2. Also an over use of previous assets, reused content, no variation in enemy types, no new subclasses, and all around no justification for a new release. For any veteran Destiny player, this was not as much a surprise knowing the state that D1 was released in. The release of Destiny 2, however, was an even more egregious sin, being that Bungie had 3 years behind their belt in the form of player feedback for D1, and clear improvements made over the games lifespan. This was not a whim of ignorance, but rather a deliberate manipulation of the player base into believing that Bungie had their best interests in mind. Every action taken in making this sequel was to fatten Bungie's wallets and pull back the amount of work that the developer had to roll out, to the detriment of the player base. Coming into yr2 of D2, the game will potentially be back to its former glory after a year of catching up, Bungie being millions of dollars richer in the process. Shame on them."
Call of Duty: Black Ops III,PlayStation4,4,"This has to be one of the worst Call of Duties ever. Don't bother purchasing this game, sad to see the Call of Duty franchise die but it is what it is. Poor game."

The Witness,PlayStation4,10,"The Witness has been on my radar ever since the announcement of the PlayStation 4.  Right away the bold and colorful world grabbed my attention.

The development cycle was long but well worth theThe Witness has been on my radar ever since the announcement of the PlayStation 4.  Right away the bold and colorful world grabbed my attention.  The crazy thing, this entire world is based purely around solving puzzles.  It was quite a bold idea, especially making such a extreme departure from the Jonathan's Blow last game Braid.  The development cycle was long but well worth the wonderfully polished game that was the result.  Built upon a beautiful island, The Witness is a very challenging and rewarding puzzle game that will simulate your brain for hours on end.The concept seems simple enough.  Scattered around this island is hundreds of panels.  All these panels having a starting point and an ending point.  Its your job to draw a line to connect the two ends.  The challenge is each section of puzzles will throw different obstacles at you.  Just to give  couple examples; this could include separating blocks of different colors, matching up sets of circles, to making specific shapes as you draw your line.  When you enter a new area you'll usually find a sets of five side by side panels that function as tutorials.  This game will never tell you what to do, it instead relies one you to be smart enough to progress.This game is deceptively straight forward.  There is so much more to this game then just walking from one panel to the next.  There are a series of well hidden bonus puzzles tied to the mysterious black monoliths scattered around the island.  One of my favorite things I found was the movie theater.  The theater itself isn't too difficult to open but you'll need to have truly mastered the various puzzle elements to find the movies.  A boat is available to take you around the island and may help you notice things you may not have seen before.The amazing artwork combined with the island setting really sets the mood for this game.  You really start to feel like your on a luxurious island retreat.  Pillows and couches can be found lying about inferring that the challenge of these puzzles my make one self tired over time.  Various ledges and buildings will give you breath taking views of the island.  It amazing to see this huge island you've spent hours exploring and conquering seem so shrunken from up high.  Those who crave exploration will want to explore every nook and cranny of this world for its abound with secrets.I you like to challenge yourself and test your intellect you need to play this game!  The puzzles are numerous and the different sections of the game are superbly designed.  In each area they'll start you off with fairly straight forward puzzles and slowly add more complexity.  By the time you get to the end of a section you'll be amazed at the crazy things you've able to accomplish.  If the puzzles weren't rewarding enough every secret you find will bring a burst of joy and excitement.  The incredibly high ceiling of challenge with no written or spoken tips means that this game isn't for everybody but those who can keep their cool will find a wonderful sense of accomplishment playing through this game."
God of War,PlayStation4,2,"I stopped playing the game shortly after the ""AMAZING FIRST BOSS"" because I was too bored with the story and gameplay to go on.

The game is very much clinging to the coattails of TLoU, which had the same cheap gimmick (hard-boiled action-dad and his spunky kid) but much, much better writing. I only gave the game a chance in the first place because critics claimed it did something interesting with Norse mythology. However, I found Kratos' son, Atreus, to be an annoying dispenser of Cliff's Notes and the first boss (who WOULD NOT SHUT UP) to be just another in a long line of GoW pro-wrestlers. Seriously, the first boss was terribly-written.The fluid, button-mashing combat that the GoW series is known for is gone in this entry. The camera is too close, attacks too slow, and errors too costly. Combat is slow, walking is slow, everything about the game is just too slow. The game world is beautifully designed but could not save me from being bored by the story and combat. This entry of the series claims to be a mature reinvention of a notoriously campy (despite its subject matter) series. GoW (2018) takes itself much too seriously to still have WWE-reject bosses. Games writers need to push themselves harder to make the actions of their characters (even when motivations are concealed) more realistic. It is good to be different and I am always hopeful to be engaged by a great story and interesting characters, but this game doesn't have any of that for me. I hated the gameplay, was not inspired by the story, and was unmoved by the characters."
The Last of Us Remastered,PlayStation4,10,"I never thought that a game would make me so well, the story and the beauty of this game made me want to play without stopping, just fell in love, this among the best games I've ever played, I never get tired of playing, this game is a work of art"

I've spent most of my 150+hrs playing this game going ""ooo"" and ""ahhh"" at how beautiful it is, how much I fell in love with the characters and at how quickly the time went when playing it. I feel the length of the palaces (aka dungeons) may be off putting to some but on the whole they are interesting and have unique puzzles. My favourite aspect of the game is the velvet room/persona fusing and this is much more fun for me in P5 than P4 due to the ease of the menu layouts. I've just finished this game and I think it's damn high quality for money. Atlus haven't disappointed and there's a lot to discover with P5."

Overall, despite what people say, there is plenty of gameplay here and machine games has included side operations too, as a sort of shield from complaints that its too short, and they work fine if just readjustments to the same maps in the world.Looking back on this game overall, I was in constant state of enjoyment, and that I cannot deny, there are very mixed opinions in terms of users for this game, and all i can say is you might hate it or love it. But its certainly worth finding out, because this game is surprisingly creative."

Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor,PlayStation4,8,"Shadow of Mordor could be epic, and most of the time feels like its heading in that direction, but then....just isn't. The game does a lot of things right, and a lot of things that other games don't do. To judge a book by its cover Shadow of Mordor looks great, and once you dive in it is great. However, the game is held back later on by a lack of impact and replayability.Shadow ofShadow of Mordor could be epic, and most of the time feels like its heading in that direction, but then....just isn't.

However, the game is held back later on by a lack of impact and replayability.Shadow of Mordor looks great. I wasn't blown away by the technical prowess of the graphics, but everything looks sharp. The character models are well done, combat animations are fun to watch and the world looks, for the most part, realistic. The blood and guts gore adds to the oppressive tones of the title, though does go a bit far. Its only the second time my wife has asked me not to play a game in front of her (the other being the original The Darkness). There are plenty of games out there I wouldn't play in front of children, but there are far fewer I wouldn't feel comfortable playing with other adults around, and this one crosses that line at times. The gore isn't sadistic nor necessarily over the top, but it is frequent and bloody. The voice acting and sound are solid and add to the experience. There were no characters or enemies that sounded out of place or had poor acting, and the main cast was solid from start to finish. Overall, a solid start to finish presentation that won't blow you away, unless you love seeing gore, but has a high floor that doesn't disappoint.The gameplay is where the game shines. The combat is fun, fluid and gets better as you level up so it doesn't stagnate. I would compare the gameplay favorably to the Batman Arkham series (which I enjoy) but my friends equate it to the Assassin's Creed games (which they enjoy). As you level you gain a sense of power slowly but surely. Where a few weak enemies early in the game would quickly kill you, by the end of the game you are able to easily dispatch even the most powerful enemies you come across. The world is easy to navigate and rarely becomes frustrating, save for the times you want to just get a certain collectible but have to cut through a horde of enemies to collect it. The stealth is fun, if a bit clunky. Once you figure the system out it becomes simple to stealth through areas sniping enemies with the bow, but there's always that sense of suspense as a horde of enemies can come crashing down if you make a wrong move. The minigames are varied and fun, ranging from stealth assassinations to last stand type situations with your bow to freeing prisoners through whatever means are available. They can become frustrating later on in the game as there are no checkpoints, so if you fail you have to start over. This can be even worse for the stealth minigames as you can make a mistake so easily.This may be a small spoiler, but to anyone who has watched a trailer for the game you will know the end goal of the game is army building. To take over Sauron's army by controlling their minds and turning them against him. This was what made me want to play the game so badly. Be able to build an army and take it into combat. It's extremely fun and rewarding to find the captains you want and take control of them. You are then able to assist them on the missions they undertake, much like you are able to hinder enemy captains as they undertake missions. The problem is it doesn't really do you a lot of good. Yes, it's fun to get into a brawl and have an ally captain come with his small group of soldiers to aid you, but the problem is that it's not really all that useful. Captains will be where they are and you can't command them anywhere else. And the commands you can give them are very limited and don't allow for a lot of strategy beyond trying to position captains you control to become a warchief. Once they are warchiefs they become slightly more useful, but only as a means to kill off enemy captains. The one really annoying hiccup I did run into with the system was if you control enough captains the game feels hollow, as there aren't anything besides basic enemies to fight and not a lot to do with the captains you do control. Army building is extremely fun and rewarding until you realize that it's not really all that useful in the grand scheme of the game, though by that point you'll be powerful enough to rip through any enemy that comes across you. You have an army, which is fun, but it's an army that just wanders around.Shadow of Mordor is fun, rewarding and does a lot of things right. The floor is high as everything is done well. Unfortunately there are enough issues to keep the game from being epic. I would equate Shadow of Mordor to a book that draws you in, makes you want to keep going, makes you invested in the characters and then just....kind of peters out. The game is spent doing a lot of fun things, that make you invested in what's going on, only to surprise by just kind of ending without great resolution or impact."
Fallout 4,PlayStation4,4,"The game is disappointing. The story is very predictable, missions are boring and do not make sense most of the time. Regardless of decisions or path you take the ending is the same. Very disappointing."
Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus,PlayStation4,10,"Amazing game. Amazing gameplay, fps mechanics and story. Love the way they've managed to balance story progression with some great action. All the negative reviews come from butt hurt Nazis."

The monster hunter series has always been simultaneously cheerful, whimsical and almost playful while throwing you into the gaping jaws of massive behemoths that will rip you limb from limb. This game isn't the grim-dark saga that most western audiences may have come to expect but when you get cornered by a dragon you can't hope to defeat, the fear you will feel will be palpable and you will feel smaller than you ever thought you could outside of a FromSoftware title.But this is intentional, as the themes of this series have always been; overcoming challenges, becoming truly skilled and actually being a badass. You will start by getting decimated by a horrifying beast only to come back hours later wearing the skins of your previous kills to slaughter that same beast you used to fear. This character progression isn't told through cut-scenes; it happens directly to you, the player. The rewarding, empowering sensation is one that has to be felt to understand and is addictive by nature which is why these games are designed to be played for ages.If you want to take a dive into a profoundly deep game that will keep you coming back for hundreds and hundreds of hours, then this game is absolutely for you. If you take the time to learn how the game systems work and how the mechanics impact the gameplay and monster battles you will find a level of complexity and depth that is almost without equal. This game feels alive, the environments are hostile and the monsters will not pull their punches. But if you want to experience an action rpg with heart, soul and depth then look no further because this is amazing time to be a monster hunter"

Final Fantasy XV,PlayStation4,10,"This game has its flaws, but it's well worth your time for its scenes alone.Scene: 12/10 the best scenes I've ever seen in a game.

Persona 5,PlayStation4,10,"I love Persona and most importantly of all, I love the Shin Megami Tensei series which itself has plentiful of great RPGs, such as Devil Survivor, Digital Devil Saga, Strange Journey and my very first game, Lucifer's Call (or Nocturne). I'll be very biased but for good reasons!Case in point, why is Persona 5 good? Well let's start with the graphics - HOLD ON, I know you might thinkI love Persona and most importantly of all, I love the Shin Megami Tensei series which itself has plentiful of great RPGs, such as Devil Survivor, Digital Devil Saga, Strange Journey and my very first game, Lucifer's Call (or Nocturne). I'll be very biased but for good reasons!Case in point, why is Persona 5 good? Well let's start with the graphics - HOLD ON, I know you might think that graphics don't matter and I totally agree with you, however, Persona 5 has a unique style that makes the graphic stylish and very interesting to look at. The game's flashy, colorful, cel-shaded and incredibly well designed: the other game that just came to mind was persona 4 with its colorful environment, but persona 5 ramps it up to 11 and makes the game look beautiful, as well as stylish. I mean...just look at the intro, or at the choice option, at the menu screen: it reeks of ""pop"", something that reminds me of the 90s it's just incredible. Again, the only game that I felt this way was persona 4 and that game was already great in the visual ways.How's the gameplay? It's turn-based combat at its finest, a system that not many seem to like because ""it's too old"", but Persona 5 not only uses it yet again to show that it's still valid but improves it, expands it and includes elements from previous SMT such as the demon dialogues to recruit shadows and, most importantly of all, better and non-randomized dungeons (although the random dungeon still exists, it's just a sidequest). The combat controls are much more simplified and much faster too, making you switch persona on a whim, add the fact that the combat was simplified by removing ""damage type"" (there was slash, pierce and blunt) and also improving physical attacks (they do more damage than before and miss a lot less), the game really shines through with ease.Granted, I didn't enjoy how little the SP is and how quickly it runs out, and how hard it is to get items for recovering SP in general, but that's a nitpick at worst.And while I won't spoil the story, I honestly found it simple yet interesting, very interesting...to the point that ""I just had to know what was going to happen"". I kept wondering what was going to happen after the next dungeon was over and while the game hints with its flashback scenes - another nitpick because I highly despise flashbacks - I still wanted to know what was going to happen to the characters.Right the characters: I really love them, especially Morgana and how he's so sure of himself yet adorable at the same time. I won't lie: I didn't like Teddy in p4 for how ""disgustingly"" nice he was, but Morgana just felt more of a reliable character overall. The others are also pretty likable and very...relatable too: they're disliked by everyone, they're people who did big mistakes, they're people with difficult childhoods. In other words, they're misfits who struggle to get into the Japanese society and the MC has a criminal record too. It was very refreshing: unlike p4 and it's cheerful, the bright cast of super happy characters with no worries in their world, the p5 cast is yes cheerful and happy but has also to worry about their ranks and their place in society.And as someone who has a mentality far different from the country he currently lives in (I did live abroad for few years while younger), I can totally relate too.I want to add my nitpicks as well, with my biggest being them taking a lot from p4 in terms of time management: you can only go into the dungeon in the afternoon and do NOTHING at night ""because you're tired"", forcing you to plan far ahead of time. Doing the dungeon literally limits your daily routine in many ways: you can't study, you can't go out and do a bath, you can't create lockpicks (VERY needed), you can't even hang out with friends...nothing. So be ready to program your stuff!Secondly, the game map is very...confusing at first and I honestly got lost quite a lot before being able to quick travel to my locations. I guess it's because of the camera being free but I won't lie that I found myself wandering cluelessly for the first 10 hours.And third, the time for clearing dungeons is VERY SHORT: talking about 2 to 3 weeks tops and not only that, your time limit is shorter because you're supposed to do ""something"" BEFORE finishing the dungeon, which requires an additional day. Which means, DON'T REACH THE END ON YOUR LAST DAY, OR IT'S GAME OVER.And now for a bigger flaw: the game doesn't allow streaming and while it doesn't affect me, a friend of mine does and I thought to add this up for those who are hardcore streamers like her.With that said, go get this game if you miss the old JRPGs, those with turn based combat, great stories and rewarding system. It's not perfect by any means it sure is close to being it!"
Battlefield 4,PlayStation4,10,"This is my first time playing a battlefield game after playing COD in the past. There's no comparison, this game is COD on steroids. Playing COD is underwhelming and boring now compared to BF4. The amount of detail put into this game is amazing and it really pays off in multiplayer."

With finicky controls and gameplay that makes you spend most of your time backtracking and trying to remember what goes where, this is hardly a survival horror game at all. The entire mansion is just a great big puzzle. If you want to play this game for nostalgia purposes then this game is right around your alley. But if you are a first-timer to the Resident Evil series, like myself, then I would go into this game with caution. At only $20.00 dollars on the PSN store it is not a bank breaker, but it is still a mediocre game."

Overall I really enjoyed this game if you see it in a sale or for a good price its a great way to get into a fighting game and into the fighting game community in general since it does an amazing job teaching terms and how to do them (stuff like zoning, chip damage ect.)"
Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain,PlayStation4,5,"The first half of the game was really good, it looked great, ran great, and played great, but the second half keeps the first two parts but completely forgets the 3rd. MGSV's not an awful game, but it could have been so much more."

Love the universe, love the graphics. Whereas downgraded the game still looks stunning on PS4, especially considering the huge scale and complexity of the world here. Many times during gameplay I just stop to admire the landscapes. Gameplay wise everything works smoothly, in fact Ive had some issues with too sensitive camera while starting the game but changed the custom controller camera set up here (fixed the sticks sensitivity to 0.80-0.85) and since then everything have been working perfect. I would recommend to do it for anyone having problems with ""weird"" camera in the game, should help a lot. This game never feels boring, the world is full of quests and places to discover, you will not find the dull side quests from Dragon Age. Overall this is a superb game which should keep you entertained for 100+ hrs. Great job CDP Red! 10/10"
