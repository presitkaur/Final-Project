Xenoblade Chronicles X,WiiU,10,"El mejor JRPG que he jugado en los ultimos 10 años, precioso, profundo, las mecanicas del combate muy fluido, dificultad muy variada, los skells son increibles, las misiones secundarias van de la mano para alargar el juego, es increible"

The adaption of the pad's gyroscope allows for a more direct experience with certain items that allows the player to be more involved and works very well. Of course, the player can choose to play the game in the original format which is always a plus.Wind Waker's world is massive and I mean massive. It's a gorgeous world to be explored but its sheer size means most of the map is empty with maybe a treasure here or there with most of it being rupees. That being said, one of the biggest problems was sailing was tedious if you wanted to explore in the original but this new one fixes it by offering a special item that cuts travel time quickly and allows the world to be explored more efficiently. Another improvement is the game's flow, modifications to a certain aspect of the game allows for the experience to feel more fluid and less choppy near the end. With these improvements, Wind Waker HD is without a doubt one of the best Zeldas.Also I just love the art style, it's very charming."
Splatoon,WiiU,10,"Es un juego novedoso y extremadamente divertido y adictivo, no puedes parar de jugar. Lo mejor es que, apesar de ser juego de disparos, no tienes que matar para ganar, sino pintar a diestra y siniestra para ganar la partida. Lo recomiendo muchísimo."
Mario Kart 8 DLC Pack 1,WiiU,8,"Great DLC, especially for the price. The tracks are great! My only complaint is the characters; would have rather seen Link, Zelda, and Ganondorf as the three new characters rather than yet another version Mario and Peach.There are already too many versions of Mario and Peach in the game before this too! Why do we need silver and gold versions of these characters? Or baby versions?Great DLC, especially for the price. The tracks are great!

Why do we need silver and gold versions of these characters? Or baby versions? They should have done it like Yoshi/Shy Guy colors and just give the users options to select from when using Mario or Peach, rather than make all of these versions of them be separate characters.Disappointed with the lack of effort on the characters, especially on a Zelda-themed DLC when there are plenty of characters from the Zelda series to include instead (such as Zelda herself!). So -1 point for each of the bad characters that were included = 8 OVR."

Super Mario 3D World,WiiU,10,"This by far the best mario game in my opinion (yes even better than super mario galaxy 1, 2 and 64). Everything about this game is perfect. The jazzy music is nice to hear. Also, there are over 100 levels to explore. In addition, the graphics are so good. Last but not least, the levels are so colourful and memorable. Each level is cleverly designed and has something differemt to offer.This by far the best mario game in my opinion (yes even better than super mario galaxy 1, 2 and 64).

Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze,WiiU,10,"DKCTF is challenging, beautiful and its controls are nigh perfect. Level design is among the best, most intricate and imaginative in any platformer.

Super Mario 3D World,WiiU,10,"I was very underwhelmed by 3D Land, and after seeing the first trailer for this game, it looked like a rather dull sequel. Fortunately, this couldn't be less true.

With the Cat Suit, Double Cherry, Cannon Box, Goomba Hat, and more, it feels like there's a new power up almost every level. The amount of variety here is insane - whereas 3D Land got boring and repetitive after awhile, every level in this game is fresh and completely different from the previous levels. This is the culmination of the best elements of New Super Mario Bros, 3D Land, and Mario Galaxy, with some brilliant original ideas and great new power ups as well. On top of all that, there's beautiful HD visuals, an excellent and completely original soundtrack, and the incredibly fun addition of 4-player multiplayer, which surprisingly works better here than in 2D Mario.While it doesn't quite reach the incredible standard set by Mario Galaxy, this is still one of the most fun 3D platformers I've ever played and easily the best game of 2013."
FAST Racing NEO,WiiU,9,"FAST Racing NEO is very close to perfection, it is how F-Zero Wii U should look like :) I'm just curious why Nintendo didn't provide F-Zero brand for this amazing fast racing game. In conclusionFAST Racing NEO is must have game for almost Wii U owners especially for such miserable price.Peace :)"
Shovel Knight,WiiU,9,"It's a new NES games, on Wii U. It's amazing, play this game now. The sprite arts awesome, and the music makes some Megaman games music look meh at best."
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,WiiU,10,"Capolavoro assoluto , questo titolo è da 30 anni che ci ha abituato a questi capolavori ...

It always feels like the music kicks in right when you need it. I also enjoy the freedom and allowing you to choose your destination. The problem about this is you can be up againts very tough enemies without the weapons you will need to kill them. Also the shrines are probably my least favorite part about this game. They seem like someone just spent very little time on them and the also seem like a chor to advance you character. Some shrines are also very tough for beginers like me. The combat is good once you learn how to use it. In the begining i was often losing to enemies worse them me, but after a few tip videos I was getting pretty good at it."
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,WiiU,10,"Beautiful, expansive and excellent design and gameplay. Zelda: Breath of the Wild is incredible. All I want to do is play it all day.

Mario Kart 8,WiiU,7,"This game is overrated within the context of it own series, While Mario Kart 8 is a solid, fun and well designed (for the most part) it has some issues that put it away from ""perfection"". In the core Mario Kart 8 is great, the tracks are well designed and every single one has an unique charm, both visually and technically also you don't feel that the tracks are the same all of them hadThis game is overrated within the context of it own series, While Mario Kart 8 is a solid, fun and well designed (for the most part) it has some issues that put it away from ""perfection"". In the core Mario Kart 8 is great, the tracks are well designed and every single one has an unique charm, both visually and technically also you don't feel that the tracks are the same all of them had ""personality"", their own gimmicks and obstacles making them fun and challenging to play. Other welcome addition new vehicle customization the game, is kind of basic but works well, it suits your play style better and the vehicle classes (Kart ,bike, sport bike and ATV) bring balance to the game and more variety some vehicles like karts are better in straight line tracks while others like the sport bikes do better in sharp curves tracks, picking your vehicle is no longer a ""it looks cool"" fact it's about what vehicle suits you best and it brings more depth in the game. Also Drifting and mini turbo are nearly mandatory in the game, there's no longer an automatic or manual option, fortunately performing a drifting is vey easy unlike Mario kart wii and more responsive, master it to perform the super mini turbo requires a little practice but nothing hard or out of place, while it's possible to play the game without drifting is a game breaker if you decide to not, since all the CPU by default do it, and most of the players also do it because is to simple to execute, so don’t be surprised if you lose most of the time because you are not drifting. So at this point it sounds that Mario Kart 8 is a game that involves pure skill, well yes but also involves luck in the form of items the series had since the beginning you know throwing shells at opponents, using mushrooms to boost, that kind of stuff, unfortunately the very items is the downfall of Mario Kart 8, making it a game more about luck than skill. It's true that in Mario Kart luck comes to place but in past MK games skill was a more important factor sure you can be in 10th place and get cool items like the golden mushroom and bullet bills, but no matter how good the items were they meant little if the guy at 1st place was good at driving, and Mario kart 8 is the complete opposite for the most part, is more about the items you get than how good you are at driving. Let me go more in depth in Past Mario Kart Games, Like Mario Kart Wii for instance there was always called ""item priority"" this means that the lower you are in the place list you'll get better offensive items like a star, 3 red shells, a lighting, etc. and the higher you were you'll get basic offensive items and more defensive items, like a single red shell, bananas, green shells etc. So it worked well giving the guy in 12th place an edge to pass the opponents while giving the guy in fist place basic items to ""shield"" him/herself from the rest. In Mario Kart 8 that is no more, Item priority now is random, except from the guy in first place, so now you van get stars in 3rd place, triple red shells in second, lightning in fourth and even a bullet bill in fifth place, but in 1st place is more common to get the new coin item that a defensive item like a green shell, the coins in the game act like a boost you can collect them in the track or by getting one at the item box, collect 10 of them and you'll gain a little speed boost, the problem is that collecting 10 coins is way to easy and most of the time in 1st place you'll stock up real quick, not to mention that the coin item still appears even if you are max out, this means that the game somehow has the 1st place items prioritized by making coins more common that actual items, so this means that if you manage to get to 1st place there's barley any way to defend yourself from items. So that just throw over the window the whole skill add-ons like customization and drifting, sure there's some skill involved but now the guy that gets the better items wins this is way more notorious if you play online. So follow my strategy, don't ever try to be on first place the whole race always try to be in 3rd or lower that way you'll get all the cool items while the lead player can barely do anything to protect him/herself and when the final lap comes then try to lead the race at the half of the track, is more likely that you'll win this way than by trying to speed up all the time. Also there's no battle mode, well it is but is way to broken, the battles are without a radar in the main tracks, so yeah no battle arenas just tracks, is very uncomfortable to play, you'll spend 99% of the time trying to look for the other players and is just not fun at all. Mario Kart 8 still of its flaws still a good, fun game and you can have a great time with it, but is way to far to be the best Mario kart game."

The ship crashes and the explorers are stranded and separated.Once reunited, they must collect fruit and track down another explorer who has found and taken their missing hyperdrive key (Which they need to get home). Pikmin 3 looks beautiful; textures gleam and reflect the sunlight, Bulborb spots get slightly bigger and smaller as the bulborbs snooze in the open plains, and cave areas are dark and moist. Boss battles, though some are obvious (HEY LOOK YOU MIGHT WANT TO THROW ROCK PIKMIN AT THAT OKAY!!?!?!?!?) others will stump you (I'm looking at YOU, 3rd (Major) boss.) and others are just fun. Enemies can be attacked in certain areas for more damage (Eyes, etc.), and you can command captains to do things using a map. Everyone who plays games should at least try this game, and enjoy its super fun and adorable gameplay, characters, and strategic gameplay."
Mario Kart 8,WiiU,9,"I really enjoyed this game! Now, it does have its issues, but first, what's good about it; the controls are nearly similar to Mario Kart Wii, and while I was worried about this, the underwater/parasail segments from Mario Kart 7 were actually easilly controllable. The visuals? Amazing. It is SO enjoyable playing a Mario Kart game in beautiful HD! The new items were cool, though II really enjoyed this game!

The visuals? Amazing. It is SO enjoyable playing a Mario Kart game in beautiful HD! The new items were cool, though I personally find the fireball item a bit useless; maybe it's just me, but unless you have good aim or just get lucky, it's pretty difficult to hit opponents with it. The new levels are just GLORIOUS; Electrodrome is my personal favorite track! I'd also like to mention that the online functionality is WAY more improved from MKWii's; I love the tournament option personally! The anti-gravity is a cool feature, but honestly, though not to this degree, I've seen the concept before in another racing game, Crash Nitro Kart, sideways tires and all!  Now, on to the bad; first and foremost, the battle mode. Everyone's said this already, and my opinion's no exception, but I think it was a bad idea to implement actual racetracks as battle courses instead of arenas. Secondly, when you're first place in a race, you'll usually get coins as items, which can be real frustrating, especially when you're trying to defend yourself. Also, Rainbow Road? Not exactly a challenge, which is considered a nitpick, but c'mon; everyone knows Rainbow Road is the craziest course in any Mario Kart game! So, all-in-all, while I'd like to give this game a 10, personally, those major issues do hold the game back a bit. But regardless, this game is pretty neat, so if you have a Wii U, definitely get it!"
Super Smash Bros. for Wii U,WiiU,9,"I just can't have enough of this game. Huge fighters pool, character customization, a lot of game modes, online battles, incredible local multiplayer. The only reason of the 9 is because i've missed the story mode of the Wii Version."

I think the most valued addition to this game must have been the stellar multiplayer comprising of up to four players each controlling their own character. Having played through the various Mario Galaxy games, I found their multiplayer functionalities quite lacking and it was fantastic to finally have a 3D Mario game that the whole family can enjoy. However, it is important to note that the game is rather easy at times. In some instances, I would find myself completing scores of levels without taking hit. Rest assured, it was miraculous that such a game could still hold such an appeal without resorting to unfairly difficult game mechanics just to string the player along."

It is possible to avoid some of the framerate drops in the Switch version by playing it in handheld mode, but they're otherwise identical.Some framerate issues, repeated unskippable cutscenes, overactive weapon degradation, and extremely segmented puzzle elements are the biggest marring points on what is otherwise probably my favourite Zelda game to date. The worst thing that can probably be said about it is that it ""isn't Zelda""; which isn't completely inaccurate in terms of the structure and progression of the game. Conventional dungeons have been replaced with a series of 120 shrines, best described as puzzle rooms, which are how you upgrade your health and stamina now. Other than that, the world is yours to explore and discover at your leisure, including running dick-first into the endgame at any point that you might feel particularly masochistic. Some people evidently are not a fan of this, but personally I think it is a LONG overdue revitalization of the series, and overall a flawed masterpiece."

Splatoon also has a fairly deep single-player campaign that is worth playing and a split screen Co-op mode. This is a nice change of pace when it comes to recent shooters and is enjoyable. Splatoon may look childish with it's colours and non violent game-play but you will be surprised how complex it feels. Winning/Playing earns you XP and Currency witch is used to level up/unlock new items then customize your character to your play style, Splatoon has a huge section for weapons from small auto rifles,big paint rollers,sniper rifles and much more. Weapons aren't the only things you can buy and upgrade, Hats, Shirts etc all available as well and consistently changing. Almost everything in Splatoon rotates on a 4 hour clock, New Maps, New Cloths etc all are available every 4 hours.This helps to keep the game fresh and new. The world Splatoon takes place in is amazing, It has little details everywhere you notice and makes you feel like your playing in a real world not just a city made to disguise lobby/loading screens. Music in Splaton is great as well, most times I find myself playing my own music but not with this game. Splatoon is a great shooter for anyone with a Wii-U regardless of age and I highly recommend you try it."

However, I am still going to give this game a 10 for the 5 to 8 hours that it does provide. I felt thoroughly immersed in Shovel Knight's quirky world and I really felt like I was on an adventure; this is a sensation I may have never before felt in a 2D platformer with the possible rose-tinted nostalgic exception of Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island.It is the little touches that does it: the themed level designs, the weird villagers, the goofy dialog before boss fights, certain playful enemy designs, and the little camping scenes after levels that give you a concept of the passing of time. It all serves to draw you into the world and gives the game a distinct tone and ethos.All that aside, the fundamental gameplay is rock-solid if perhaps a little on the easy side for a veteran. The new game plus ratchets up the difficulty a little bit, but I still could beat any section of a stage within 3 tries in general or 6 tries in the one or two most extreme cases (the boss rush and another section of the last few stages). I was still enjoying myself though, so I hesitate to even call this a drawback exactly.I just wish there were more game. I look forward to the Order of No Quarter play-throughs as Plague Knight, King Knight, and  Specter Knight. I feel like that more or less addresses any problems I have with replay value. And frankly, I feel like the most negative reviews I have seen for this game, neglect considering the prospect of additional content when admonishing the game for lack of replay-ability (though I do recognize that it is their job to review the product at hand). Perhaps I am being overly optimistic, but it is hard not to be optimistic about those expansions having seen the quality of the content already present.So yeah: This game is awesome and I am excited for more shovel knight in the  coming months.If you like 2D platformers then this game is a must buy in my book."

As while the multiplayer in it has evolved and lost the majority of it's networking issues what happened to the community system from mk7? It worked great and they had every opportunity to work on that but instead we're left with a tournament feature which while it does work for setting up game tournaments it doesn't for managing your community of players for game nights on the clock. I did also have a few nit picks with the item system this time around as while I'm glad they nerfed blue shells into the ground item pickups across different race placings is broken (5th place gets a bullet bill, 8th get's a single banana) focusing more on defensive drops rather than mario kart's previous offense with the majority of drops being shells. My last issue is that they removed a lot of the fan classic characters and tracks. We only get one snes track (donut plains 3) which is terrible when considering the other snes tracks and the retro and new tracks as a whole don't have many standouts. But you probably know all the pros with the game, like amazing graphics tight control etc. If you own a wii u this is a must buy. And if you don't I strongly recommend keeping your eye on the wii u now for more great releases now that mk8's been released."

My depression has been cured because I just realized that I am blessed to be born in this era to experience this game. Thank you Nintendo, and above all, thank you God."
Splatoon,WiiU,10,"I'm not big into online multiplayer games, but I've sunk many hours into Splatoon since it was released last week. It's a lot of fun. Just don't expect local multiplayer because it doesn't really have that (yes, there's a 1 vs. 1 mode, but it's not very much fun)."
Bayonetta 2,WiiU,10,"This game is perfect. Building upon what the first game offered, the sequel offers a great experience from beginning to end. The combat is great, with all weapons being useful in any situation but excelling in certain battles. The graphics look great with the scenery offering some beautiful views.

This is a perfect game that, despite being aimed at older audiences, is an absolute great exclusive for nintendo is definitely a must own for all Wii-U owners."
Bayonetta 2,WiiU,10,"This is the best game I´ve ever played and you also have to try it out. It´s worth to buy a Wii U just for this awesome game!!! It´s so much fun to play and the combat system has infinite combos, you can find out or  practise in training mode."
Splatoon,WiiU,9,"It is the next BIG franchise game from Nintendo, I really love it, but I would love more the game if it has more single mode stages and more to do as a single player. The lack of voice is horrible."
Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze,WiiU,10,"Since I'm a huge fan of DKC series, I thought I knew what I want. What I would like was: Kremling, Animal buddies... yeah I still miss them but Tropical Freeze is a game that proved me that I really don't know what I want. The game surprised me in such a great way, I almost didn't miss Kremling's and animal buddy.Each level is  unique, each level has so much details that we are notSince I'm a huge fan of DKC series, I thought I knew what I want.

The game surprised me in such a great way, I almost didn't miss Kremling's and animal buddy.Each level is  unique, each level has so much details that we are not used to see in games. The challenge is fair. The levels you will find in this game could inspire any game designer.  If you have a Wii U, you should be playing this games instead of reading here my comments.This game is a serious candidate for the Game of the year, in my opinion."
New Super Mario Bros. U,WiiU,8,"A solid game, but nothing you haven't seen or done before in this series. Super Mario Maker really went on to prove how simple it was for Nintendo when making these titles."
Super Mario Maker,WiiU,10,"hermosa sorpresa, tiene una jugabilidad infinita y vasta, no como los juegos que salen comúnmente en las otras consolas, puedes compartir mapas, puedes jugar mapas diversos en linea, genial, con el sello de garantía de Nintendo."
The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD,WiiU,10,"Everything I disliked in this game has been replaced and now it's only a Masterpiece. After playing Skyward Sword, i can finally push a button to hit an enemy with my sword and I enjoy it!"
The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD,WiiU,9,"Still holds up better than 90% of everything released today.  The HD and the little refinements are just the gravy on top.  Could have used an inverted camera for 3rd person and shifting wind directions can be annoying at times, but that is all I can really hammer it for.  Now gimme a brand new Zelda, Nintendo."
Rayman Legends,WiiU,10,"Best Wii U game ever, best platform game ever, best multiplayer ever, best art ever, best characters ever, best soundtrack ever ... Ubisoft did really well making revolutionary platform game who make playing with friends really funny."
Pikmin 3,WiiU,10,"This is a great strategy. Now rare to find a game that is not afraid to be demanding for the player and make him a challenge. Uparvlenie the game is marvelous, especially with the Wiimote."
Mario Kart 8,WiiU,9,"After the horrible balanced Mario Kart Wii and the for me pretty boring Mario Kart 7 it was a surprise how well Mario Kart 8 turned out... only Double Dash!! is still a bit better, and sure we are missing the battle mode a bit... but I only really enjoyed this in Double Dash!! so without two people in one Kart and a huge load of Items I don't really miss it."
Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Director's Cut,WiiU,8,"Deus Ex is a great game which unfortunately is now showing its age released on the WiiU. I was surprised to find that the graphics are inferior to the xbox360 version, which I spent a lot of time playing. The gamepad is used to good effect and genuinely addes to the experience. For me the best aspect of the WiiU version (and the best part of the WiiU in general) is the fact that it offersDeus Ex is a great game which unfortunately is now showing its age released on the WiiU.

Mario Kart 8,WiiU,1,The levels are simply gorgeous. The cart variety keeps the game fresh. The small yet critical changes made to the game affect how you play compared to previous titles. This game is for the hard core player while also being a living room favorite. My only hope is that battle gets updated because right now it is lack luster at best.
Xenoblade Chronicles X,WiiU,8,"Um jogo a ser aclamado pelo seu mapa extenso e belos graficos, quantidade de quests supreende mas o foco da historia se perde conforme vamis progredindo no jogo este é o unico negativo que encontro nele mas assim mesmo é indispensavel para qualquer gamer que curta um jrpg."
Super Smash Bros. for Wii U,WiiU,8,This game is very enjoyable. The online is better then brawl. And lots of characters to choose from. The 3ds prevented more characters and the ice climbers though (RIP ice climbers). But a few things annoyed me about this game. No adventure mode. I LOVED the adventure mode in brawl. Sadly they removed it in Wii u. The online can also be annoying and pretty bad. Better then brawl tho. ButThis game is very enjoyable. The online is better then brawl.

NBA 2K13,WiiU,9,This game is an 8 something by itself on all three platforms. It's no different graphically on the Wii U. But being able to play it on the controller is awesome and gets it at least a nine in my book.
Super Smash Bros. for Wii U,WiiU,9,"The next installment of the Super Smash Bros series is a solid addition. While there are no revolutionary breakthroughs, it still adds upon what was there in previous games and makes it worth the buy.The new additions to the series are fun to play and have a unique style. Characters like Mega Man and Shulk bring new playstyles the series has never really seen, so the roster is sure toThe next installment of the Super Smash Bros series is a solid addition. While there are no revolutionary breakthroughs, it still adds upon what was there in previous games and makes it worth the buy.The new additions to the series are fun to play and have a unique style. Characters like Mega Man and Shulk bring new playstyles the series has never really seen, so the roster is sure to have a character or several to suit every player. A few characters like Dark Pit and Lucina are the familiar clone archetype, matching other characters almost exactly, but this is nothing new for the series and doesn't detract from the much more numerous novel additions.Smash 4 also adds custom moves and items. The items allow players to customize their characters by increasing their attack power, defense, or speed as well as adding additional abilities. An increase in one stat necessarily means a decrease in another, however, preventing the customization ability from getting too far unbalanced. Custom moves also give players the option to change special moves to something more suiting their playstyle. While these features can add some fun variability, Smash 4 does not allow their use online with strangers, somewhat limiting their fun. If you don't have friends who also own the game or frequently play with you, you'll only get to use your custom character against computer characters.The stage selection has a mix of the old and the new. Old favorites like Hyrule Temple and Kongo Jungle 64 make return appearances alongside a slew of brand new places. The new stages are, on average, much more... interactive than previous games' stages. There are stages that just let you be and provide footing on which to fight, but most of them want in on the action. The degree to which this is a good thing varies with the stages. Some stages, like Woolly World and Pilotwings merely switch up the ground you're standing on and can improve the gameplay by varying the terrain, but others like Mushroom Kingdom U and Orbital Gate Assault include stage hazards that are capable of KOing your character in one go. These and stage bosses can prove to be a bit much for the somewhat serious player.To offset such dynamic stages, however, is the stage builder. It has its own unique limitations, making it different but not better than Brawl's stage builder. Careful crafters can end up making gorgeous stages that are loads of fun to play on, and the lack of ability to add stage hazards guarantees it'll be relatively peaceful.The standard Smash mode adds 8-player smash, which is a useful addition if you have more than three friends over and don't want to take turns. Online provides both For Fun and For Glory modes of play, the former being a more casual take and the latter being more competitive. While it's fun to play with strangers, both these modes have their shortcomings. For Fun is limited to 4-player, all items on, 2 minute timed mode which isn't always to the taste of the players. For Glory forces the player into two stock, no items matches that can be played with four players or one on one. The unfortunate thing about For Glory is that it also forces players to fight on variations of Final Destination, a completely flat and featureless stage. For the most part, though, the excitement of fighting actual, thinking people outweighs the limitations of online play.The last real multiplayer mode is Smash Tour. This mode is very hit or miss. At its most basic, it is a board game where one collects fighters and powers them up for a duel at the end. While this may sound simple, the game throws a multitude of additional effects and rules in the game that can make it far too complicated and busy for many. For others, all the extras provide some variation to an otherwise rather simple game. It does expect you to teach a lot of the rules and strategy to yourself, however, which scares away many players.While two players can play the remaining modes, they were built with one player in mind. Target Blast replaces the target test from previous games, and while it can be enjoyable, it gets stale fast and pales in comparison to the target test, especially Melee's. On the other hand, Event Mode returns and is the most fun it's ever been. The selection is more dynamic and the challenges more difficult.The lack of a true Adventure Mode hurts the game's single player aspect, especially coming off Brawl's much loved Subspace Emissary. And while the game's large roster only helps multiplayer, it can make All Star mode drag on a bit long. Classic Mode is similarly tedious, although they're both fun in small amounts.All in all, Smash 4 took some steps back and many steps forward. Its single player isn't as enjoyable as previous titles, but its multiplayer is better than ever. Its ""worst"" aspects are only relative, and everything in the game is still quality and enjoyable. You may not be blown out of the water, but you'll still have a great time."
