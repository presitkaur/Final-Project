Grand Theft Auto V,PC,10,Absolutely incredible. It is a great game and runs smooth as butter on my gtx 980 build and also on my Asus gtx 860m laptop (surprisingly) would reccommend to anyone over the console version.
Alan Wake,PC,7,"I originally gave this a 4, because the controls were hard to get used to and the game had severe ammo/weapon limitations.  However, as the plot developed and the game spanned across some beautiful scenery, I became somewhat addicted to this game and I was able to use most of the controls.  Perhaps, I just haven't been exposed to a game where you have to rely so much on a flashlight."
World of Goo,PC,10," World of Goo's innovative game play created a unique game play experience that me laugh, gawk, laugh some more and even a little sad. Once I had beaten the game I considered going through and getting all the ""OCD"" requirements, but about half way through the game I decided I simply wanted to experience Goo again; I promptly removed it and then reinstalled it, and played through the World of Goo's innovative game play created a unique game play experience that me laugh, gawk, laugh some more and even a little sad.

World of Goo is proof that a game doesn't have to have marvelous graphics, the best multiplayer and matchmaking or even a solid plot line to be considered one of the best modern games. 100% recommended for any age, any player of any experience level."
Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen,PC,2,"dont know the hype bout this game.. as all know that every single types of monster only have 2 or 3 moves.. and the worse thing is the monster spams those 3 or 2 skills like drunken monster..this pawn also sometimes do a random attack, coz we only have 3 command which i think that doesnt imbue anything.. im stil playing a single character..and sometimes i got bugged, when idont know the hype bout this game.. as all know that every single types of monster only have 2 or 3 moves.. and the worse thing is the monster spams those 3 or 2 skills like drunken monster..this pawn also sometimes do a random attack, coz we only have 3 command which i think that doesnt imbue anything.. im stil playing a single character..and sometimes i got bugged, when i clinging.. sometimes i got teleported to its hand from its back and sometimes i teleported to its feet from its hand.."
Far Cry 3,PC,9,"(Single Player Review) As a big Far Cry 2 fan, I was happy with this game.  The story and characters are an improvement over FC2, as well as the stealth mechanics.  The wild animals are a great addition, the game formula is basically a three-way war between Pirates, Natives (your side), and Predators.  The amount of random crazy sh*t that can happen keeps the game from getting boring.  The(Single Player Review) As a big Far Cry 2 fan, I was happy with this game.

The amount of random crazy sh*t that can happen keeps the game from getting boring.  The biggest downside is that the game is too easy, especially if your the stealthy, careful type.  Fortunately there are mods, the most well-known of which is Ziggys mod, which make the mechanics, especially the HUD, more challenging, and I highly recommend it for a second playthrough.  If you liked Far Cry 2, you will probably like this game."
Battlefield 3,PC,10,"great game single player amazing, multiplayer also amazing. so much better than the beta this is a great game and i think dice have really outdone themselves"
Diablo III,PC,1,"Welcome to the WOW generation Diablo. Gear is everything, market is everything, better you go to the AH and give your 15% to Blizzard. No attributes selection, respeccable skills, you are a dumb guy, aren't you? 4 for the MUSIC. The rest is crap."
Grand Theft Auto III,PC,10,"Que maravilla lo que significo GTA3  para el mundo de los videojuegos, si bien sigue la estela de lo que fue Driver 2 en su momento mas la historia y diversión que llevan de GTA2 acá se obtiene un formula mágica que convirtió a Rockstar Games en la grande que es el dia de hoy.

Team Fortress 2,PC,9,This is probably one of the best shooters i have ever played.While there are some flaws here and there it still remains one of the best shooters of today.Also there is hats!
Firewatch,PC,6,"There is a lot to like about Firewatch, the atmosphere, the environments, the 2 main characters. The way the game is established is quite unique and whilst I don't think the choices made in that opening make any difference whatsoever, it is quite an interesting opening none the less, establishing the protagonist and his sad past.

The way the game is established is quite unique and whilst I don't think the choices made in that opening make any difference whatsoever, it is quite an interesting opening none the less, establishing the protagonist and his sad past. Unfortunately with a game like this the story is key, there is no real skill in the gameplay and whilst the environments are a joy to explore without something driving you through it's all for nothing. That said the story does a good job of driving you through the game, it's offers mystery and suspense, however the ending (explanation of the events) is utterly mundane and delivered in a very direct manner which counter acts the prior more subtle delivery methods on display in the rest of the game. Firewatch is part of an ever growing selection of exploration story games, and it adds some great things to the mix, but ultimately all of these games live and die on the story and unfortunately this one just doesn't round off well at all. In short you'll have fun playing it, but probably won't remember it with much fondness."
Saints Row: The Third,PC,10,"This game is, basically, my childhood. I was 13 when it came out, and i played it like 3 times, by now. I just can't see any flaws here. This game is perfect, from the humor, to the story, to the action. 11/10, hahaha!"
Cuphead,PC,10,"Is a 360 ° masterpiece destined to become a classic and a milestone of the genre. Sublime artistic style, music and gameplay, offered at a great price that could be a bit higher for the overall quality of the work."
World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria,PC,3,"First of all, the attack on negative reviewers by the majority of positive reviewers exposes the fact that it is a select minority, perhaps even company employees, creating multiple accounts to boost the games positive rating. The whole thing reeks of self-promotion. Secondly, the expansion has dumbed the game down to ridiculous proportions. Will this appeal to everyone? No, of course not.First of all, the attack on negative reviewers by the majority of positive reviewers exposes the fact that it is a select minority, perhaps even company employees, creating multiple accounts to boost the games positive rating. The whole thing reeks of self-promotion. Secondly, the expansion has dumbed the game down to ridiculous proportions. Will this appeal to everyone? No, of course not. However, those that enjoy the game? I do honestly hope you have a great time. The expansion to me feels tired, flat and the blatant rehash of game mechanics into simpler versions does little to help the enjoyment factor. While this next point is entirely down to social perspective, playing WoW now feels embarrassing due to the multitude of fuzzy pandas played by 10 year olds running around karate kicking things. As an adult, I can't take the game seriously anymore. I just can't. The pollution of the community is also offputting. Give children anonymitity and a feeling of invincibility behind a computer screen and, well, comment sections on Youtube are all the evidence needed.Blizzard have taken the commercial route for more money over game quality and please, trying to deny this is like trying to say fish don't swim. In the interest of being fair, the Monk class is fun. On the whole however, MoP won't win back any loyal fans and certainly doesn't put Blizzard in a great light. I'd like to say at this point, I really don't like Guild Wars 2 either. The bottom line? WoW is dying a very slow death and the injection of botox that is MoP doesn't do anything to make its ultimate demise any more graceful. Just the same old tired formula. This kind of arrogance and disregard for quality simply shouldn't be encouraged."
Torchlight,PC,10,"This game does the hack n' slash genre to perfection.It is like a super-updated Diablo II, a thing the game creators don't deny, considering they also worked on DII.This is such a bargain at $15 now, that it makes me cry i wasted $60 on trash like Dragon Age II.Everyone should know about this game!!"
Unreal Tournament III,PC,10,"Its the best game I've ever played in my lifetime. 1000s of hours gameplay, and it never get boring. Its incredible much better than UT2004, UT2003 and UT99. Very nice graphic, hundrets of hidden tricks and specials, idiotic dodge-jump removed, warfare game mode introduced with orb. Seriously: Its the best game you can get for your bucks."
The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings,PC,5,"""IAM"" --- Interactive Movie --- This needs to be a new genre, because Witcher 2 is not an RPG.

Fallout: New Vegas,PC,7,"Fallout new Vegas works for some people more than it does for others. Less so for me.

Equally, people will point to its four different endings as giving the player great freedom, but actually they all boil down to much the same thing, especially as you don't get to carry on the game after you finish the main quest and there isn't yet DLC to change this. The urban environment of Fallout 3 also works better, seems to communicate better the post-apocalyptic vision. Having said that, there are good additions to new vegas such as the faction system, better voice acting, etc. It is still a very good game, with a good story, good character, graphics, etc. Most criticisms that can be made of it, asides from the ridiculous number of bugs, only tell us that fallout new vegas is not quite as great as Fallout 3."
Half-Life,PC,10," It's quite possibly the best FPS ever. Yes, the graphics are aging, yes the crate puzzles were a bit on the annoying side, but they are minor flaws on a beautiful game. The AI still amazes me now, as the soldiers hide, throw grenades and constantly cause a thread, and then there's the set pieces. I always get excited when I see the G-Man.

Minecraft,PC,9,"With the variety of play modes, Minecraft makes itself attractive to more than just one type of gamer.

Like why can't I make pizza?! ;-) And i'm looking forward to more game modes like CTF or Adventure (where one doesn't build, but runs through a pre-made level)."
Minecraft,PC,6,"A very fun game at Beta when Notch was developing it. Went downhill fast after 1.0 (full release version).

Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft,PC,10,"For starters do not listen to the people who say that this game is pay to win.

Players have reached the top of the rankings in the game without paying a penny and indeed some have reached very high just using the basic decks given to the player at the start of the game. This game can feel unfair sometimes and i believe that is what these players are feeling. However this is due to the random nature of some of the cards and the very real aspect of luck involved in drafting the right cards for the right situation. Although this leads to some seemingly unfair games it does tend to balance itself out the more games you play. Anyway now the good and the bad. (Also please remember that this game is free and every card in the game can be earned without paying a penny!)Good:Brilliant and addictive card game. The sounds and animations are both extremely satisfying and the graphics are very reminiscent of WoW which gives it a nostalgic feel. As mentioned above the payment method is rather moot depending on how you wish to play the game. If you want to jump into the game and be able to play every deck then and there you will have to sink in some money to buy packs of cards. However this is not how the game is meant to be played and is much more suited to a slow progression doing quests and arena runs (its the journey people). Not to mention skilled players have reached the top of the rankings just days after starting a new free account.Bad:So far everything has been quite positive but like every game it is not perfect (which is not what a 10 indicates fyi). The game does still even after release suffer from some annoying card swapping and overlapping bugs, these can be a real pain and even cost you games. The game is also very lacking in playing modes. Only two currently exist at launch, constructed and arena. This problem is likely to be addressed in later expansion packs or DLC but for the moment the area is lacking.Certain cards in the game are just simply stronger versions of others and are almost a 100% pick every time in a deck, this can make match ups very repetitive as you are bound to see these certain cards in every game. Unfortunately most of these cards are legendary (which are very rare) which often leads people to believe the game is pay to win (even though these cards are fully achievable through free means)."
Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings,PC,10,"It's just so goood. I enjoy playing this much more than any other RTS game, because it has more heart and soul and charm. Do you need fancy graphics to enjoy chess? Maybe if the pieces were ultra realistic statues that could move like in that Harry Potter movie. The AOE2 gameplay is perfect, love this game."
BioShock Infinite,PC,9,"AMAZING! This game has it all good story, good M rated content, good characters, and good graphics. The only thing that keeps it from a 10 is the gun play. Its bad. But other than that its a amazing game"

On top of it all, apart from perhaps the inventory UI, The Witcher 2 is very PC-friendly in all aspects. I do not hesitate to give it a 10. It's REALLY good for what it is."

It is annoying to use, and gives very little information. Tracking multiple quests at a time is also needlessly difficult. As someone who really enjoys doing side quests and trying to do everything a game has to offer, at some points in the game I felt so frustrated with the quest tracking and quest system that I just gave up on them entirely and only followed the main story. The stealth in the game is also just terrible. It looks and feels like it was scrapped together as a last minute idea, and I think the game would be better off without it just because of how dull and uninspired it is. While this game has a lot of great things, these few issues have frustrated me to the point where I just don't want to continue playing."

Only buy it if you have a solid state drive and you feel lucky. Game reviewed is version 1.1 (first patch). Score (game itself): 8 Score (game including optimisation for PC)."
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,PC,10,"Look, people, I have always been a Nintendo guy, as Nintendo games have always been my favorite ones, mostly the Zelda series. I think I have played The Witcher 3 a lot more than my favorite Zelda games, and that is saying a lot. This game delivers a unique sense of immersion in a videogame, a quality I hold among the most important features in a videogame.

I think I have played The Witcher 3 a lot more than my favorite Zelda games, and that is saying a lot. This game delivers a unique sense of immersion in a videogame, a quality I hold among the most important features in a videogame. The quests are well crafted, the characters and dialogues are amazing, the combat system is clever and very flexible... I don't think there will ever be an experience quite as fulfilling as The Witcher 3. This game is just THAT good. This is a benchmark for what a videogame needs to be in its essence."
Portal 2,PC,10,"There are only 2 perfect games out of the 157 that I have played. Portal 2 is one of them. This game is absolutely legendary. It is flawless. It is a classic of our time. It is the best puzzle game ever made. It is the best story/adventure game ever made. It comes from the best games company there has ever been. Even the lore behind the game is fascinating.

Mass Effect 3,PC,3,"Cover system isn't nearly as bad as ME1 but worse then ME2. Jennifer Hale voice acting is brilliant. Visually ME2 beats ME3. My imported Shepard looked like almost completely different person. In the end all those choices you made over 120 hours of gameplay (3 games) don't really matter.

It all boils down to the decision you make in last 15 minutes of the game and no matter what you do, it leaves a lot of unanswered questions about what happens to Shepard friends and brothers-in-arms. Bleh."
The Walking Dead: A Telltale Games Series,PC,9,"It's a compelling, emotionally charged, and very well-written story, but much more a visual novel with limited interaction than a game.  Telltale does an amazing job of making you consider your choices, but their games don't follow through much in terms of the consequences, and you can't get off the rails they've set for you.Regardless, if you're looking for an engrossing story, thisIt's a compelling, emotionally charged, and very well-written story, but much more a visual novel with limited interaction than a game.

Half-Life 2: Episode Two,PC,9," It's a little bit on the ""more of the same"" side but very much worth it."
Silent Hunter III,PC,7," The game is really good...i really enjoy submarine type games. The only down side to the game is the waiting times between action, even with time compression the game is very slow. The keyboard layout is good, and sound effects are okay...you do need 1 gig of ram to run the game, as I am running 512 megs or ram and it takes a long time for the game to load, and locks up occasionally when The game is really good...i really enjoy submarine type games.

DEFCON: Everybody Dies,PC,10," I've been waiting for this game to come out, since the movie! Thanks."
Guild Wars 2: Heart of Thorns,PC,1,"as someone who mainly runned dungeons and fractals, the changes they made killed what i do in this game. and i bought the 100$ edition to support them, now i regret wasting my money."
The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings,PC,10,"This game is **** AMAZING.I can't be bothered to type out a testament to the brilliance that is The Witcher 2, but after 3 playthroughs, I'm really disappointed that other games (that aren't as good as TW2) get a higher Metascore than TW2 (Deus Ex: HR, not that it's a bad game or anything, just nowhere near as good as TW2).One of the greatest cRPG's to ever come of existence."
The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,PC,7,"For an Oblivion's successor I would wish:- Fighting art included, where proper striking/blocking combination is as important as character stats.- Sorcerer's battles with massive lightning effects, spanning over whole screen, casting complicated spells with some key combination found in an ancient book hidden in the last corner of an abandoned elf mine.Freedom of dressing whereFor an Oblivion's successor I would wish:- Fighting art included, where proper striking/blocking combination is as important as character stats.- Sorcerer's battles with massive lightning effects, spanning over whole screen, casting complicated spells with some key combination found in an ancient book hidden in the last corner of an abandoned elf mine.Freedom of dressing where player's own ideas in plate armour combinations or different armour layers can contribute to his advantage over opponents.Characters react to situations and are not all scripted. Not much is needed, but when right after dragon attack an old lady casually asks, if I fancy a chatter, is the mood ruined.Unfortunately it stayed where Oblivion ended. At least we got:Real sized dragons (yes they did it!!)Wonderful graphic ovehaul"
World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade,PC,0, A boring game which makes people addicted! Don't start playing cause you can't stop again. And the graphics is nothing compared to many other games.
